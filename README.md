# Azure Kubernetes Fixes

I've been working in Azure Kubernetes Service for a couple of years now and I've come across a whole assortment of weird issues and edge cases. I decided I would try and make it easier to retrace my steps by keeping everything in a repository. 

As a bonus, I hope that it can maybe help others in the same place I am. 

These are mostly `README` files with some scripts mixed in. Yes, it's entirely possible that I could have put these somewhere else, but version control is nice when you're working through things.
